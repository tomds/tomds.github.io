      <h4>About me</h4>
      <p>I have been a professional full-stack web developer since 2007. I make high quality, feature-rich websites and webapps using technologies like React, Django and Node.js, among others. I am equally comfortable doing front-end and back-end development. The more complex the functionality, the better!</p>
      <p>I have been involved in all stages of the project life cycle from design through to deployment and ongoing support. I have experience of hosting websites on both cloud infrastructure and self-hosted VMs.</p>

      <p><strong>Programming languages: </strong>Python, Javascript</p>
      <p><strong>Technologies: </strong>React, TypeScript, jQuery, Django, Node.js, Flask, Postgres, MySQL, Docker, Heroku, AWS</p>

      <h4>Sustainability</h4>
      <p>As well as being a web developer, I am highly passionate about taking action to tackle climate change. I am a Director and part-time employee of <a href="https://yorkcommunityenergy.org.uk/">York Community Energy</a> and also a qualified Carbon Literacy Trainer working with <a href="https://speakcarbon.earth/">Speak Carbon Collective</a>.</p>

      <p>Naturally, I care about the climate impacts of everything I do, including web development. I take a minimalistic design approach and optimise my code as much as possible to reduce the amount of computing power required to run my websites. This translates into reduced energy usage and thus lower emissions. So if you want a website with great green credentials, I'm your dev!</p>
