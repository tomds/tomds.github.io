How perverse  
To watch the world end  
Not with a bang  
But in slow motion  
Surrounded by indifference  

Don't worry  
It's just the Amazon burning  
It's just the permafrost melting  
It's just the insects dying out  
It's just sea levels rising  
And cities running out of water  
No cause for alarm  

And so I carry on  
Go back to my job  
Spend time with the kids  
While in the corner of my mind  
I see an asteroid coming for us  
As still as a picture  
But getting ever so slightly bigger  
Every time I look at it  

It's coming for us all  
And we're very concerned  
But somehow also not concerned  
We're all too busy with our lives  
No reason to panic  
It's only the final days of humanity.
