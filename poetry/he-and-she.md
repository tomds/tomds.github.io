Through illness, school pickups and sleepless nights  
Money troubles, health scares, emergencies  
He always had she, and she always had he  
There was always a hand reaching out through the dark  
And a voice that said "Hold onto me"  
And when there were good times, joy and delight  
There was someone to share them, made ten times as bright  

To be loved is to face the world wearing armour  
And to share in a warmth so pure  
And all who see it will pray that they find  
A love that so endures
