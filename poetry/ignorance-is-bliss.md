I pray that I’m wrong, but deep down in my heart  
I know that I’m not, and it tears me apart  
The nightmare’s unfolding just outside our door  
But inside we’re calm as we lie on the floor  
And gaze at the fire, entranced by the flames  
A million miles from sordid mind games  

But outside they’re busy rewriting the rules  
Not putting out fires but pouring on fuel  
If you care you’re a traitor, if you hate you’re a saint  
Well I’ve news for you buddy: you bloody well ain’t  

Take a look out the window, breathe the ash-laden air  
Wake up, smell the coffee… while it’s still there  
Watch out for brown bodies floating on by  
While you chant “all lives matter” with a wink of the eye  

God knows how you sleep at night; I sure as hell don’t  
The heatwaves, floods, forest fires, the ice caps are toast  
Now “once in a lifetime” is “once in five years”  
And when I look at my kids I have to hold back the tears  
But sure, we’re the bad guys, disrupting your trade  
God save the economy  
So Bezos gets paid.
