My name is Tom de Simone and I'm a web developer. I live in York, UK, and am currently working for [Isotoma](http://isotoma.com).

I primarily work with [Django](http://djangoproject.com) for back-end development, and am also quite keen on working with JavaScript (front-end and back-end).

I enjoy astronomy, gardening and learning foreign languages (of the spoken/written kind).
