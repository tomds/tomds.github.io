<p>The Shadowserver Foundation is a nonprofit security organisation working with network providers, governments and law enforcement agencies around the world to keep the Internet safe from malicious actors. They collect vast amounts of threat data from the internet, collecting intel on malware, disrupting botnets and advising organisations on their security weak spots.</p>

<p>I worked as an employee of Shadowserver for six years before becoming a freelancer, and still work for them from time to time. I have been involved in a number of internal Shadowserver projects over the years, most of which I am unfortunately not allowed to discuss due to their sensitive nature. Broadly speaking, I have worked on large data collection systems, internal asset management tools and the automation of large-scale infrastructure deployments.</p>

<p>I also worked as part of a team to implement a public-facing <a href="https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/" target="_blank">dashboard</a> of threats and attacks being monitored across the globe. As well as working on the front-end UI, I worked in a devops capacity to automate deployments to the website using GitLab CI/CD pipelines.</p>
