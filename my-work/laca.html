<p>Local Authority Consumption Accounts is a tool primarily aimed at Local Authorities in the UK looking to track the per-capita carbon footprint of their region over time and compare it to others.</p>

<p>The tool allows users to create graphs of consumption-based emissions for one or more regions over a given time period, with options to show and hide various categories of consumption. Local Authorities can then download an image of the graph for use in their own materials. The data for the graphs is updated once a year, and is provided by Dr Anne Owen, a researcher at the University of Leeds, who calculates the official consumption emissions figures for the UK Government and then disseminates them to the Local Authorities.</p>

<p>Dr Owen offered the following feedback about her experience of working with me:</p>

<blockquote class="small">
    "The website functions exactly as I hoped: the charts are clean and easy to interpret and updating the data year on year is straightforward. Tom also helped me to organise a 'user workshop' where we showcased the tool to Local Authority officers and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. I highly recommend working with Tom and I hope to work with him again on further projects."
